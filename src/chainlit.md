# Assistant Demo!

This is a simple demo of using the OpenAI Assistant API to create a chatbot. The assistant has access to two tools:
1. A function to query the 2024 survey data for WSP.
1. A code interpreter, which it will use to make graphs of the survey data.

Test it by asking the assistant some questions about the survey data, for instance:
- show the survey data by location in a bar chart
- show the average scores aggregated by location a line chart
